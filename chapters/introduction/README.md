# Introduction ([Web API Guide](../../README.md))

There are different ways one _could_ create a Web (i.e., HTTP or HTTPS) based API — **but** what I describe in this guide is, in general, how I recommend it is done.

## My History

I have been programming for what feels, to me, to be a long time.

I think the first time I did any programming was back in  the early 1980s — back when I was in elementary school — writing programs in the Logo programming language.
I used the computers they had at the elementary school to do this.
My mother actually volunteered to help teach Logo programming.
(Although I don't think my mother had any programming experience before that, so I assume she picked it up just before teaching it.)
So, at least back then, my mother was involved in teaching me how to program.

Back then it wasn't common for people to have computers at home.
So, for many children, if they were programming, it was often using a computer at their school.

Later on when I was in high school, in either the late 1980s or early 1990s I did some programming in the BASIC programming language.

Still, even then, it still wasn't common for people to have computers at home.
So, for many teenagers, if they were programming, it was often using a computer at their school.

A little later on, in the 1990s, after convincing my parents to buy a personal-computer (PC) for our home, I learned how to program on my own, by reading books and magazines.

This was _before_ the Internet and the Web became ubiquitous.
So if you wanted to learn something, you couldn't just go on the Internet or the Web to learn it — really, for most people, all you had were (physical) books and (physical) magazines.
And, for books, you had to find a bookstore that sold computer programming books — which wasn't always easy.

But when I got into programming this time, I didn't stop, because I finally had access to a computer that I could program on anytime I wanted — since it was a computer we had at home.
I kept on programming, more and more and more.

Eventually, while in university (despite, at the time, mathematics being my intended major) I started taking computer science courses for fun.

Eventually I graduated and had a career as a computer programmer.
(Although my career was non-typical. And I did a lot of things that computer programmers typically don't do.)
