# Introduction ([Web API Guide](../../README.md))

There are different ways one _could_ create a Web-based API — i.e., a HTTP or HTTPS based API — what I describe in this guide is, in general, how I recommend it is done.

## My History

I have been programming for what feels, to me, to be a long time.

I think the first time I did any programming was back in the early 1980s — back when I was in elementary school — writing programs in the _Logo programming language_.
These _Logo programs_ that I and others wrote would draw pictures using _turtle graphics_ — a _vector graphics_ API for the _Logo programming language_.
I think this was an after-school-hours class that you could sign up for — and (I assume) one of my parents signed me up for it.

To do this _Logo programming_ I used the computers they had at the elementary school I was attending at the time.
Back then it wasn't common for people to have computers at home.
So, for many children, if they were programming, it was often using a computer at their school.

So for me and many other children, the only time we would have a chance to do _Logo programming_ was using the computers at our elementary school as part of a computer class.

My mother actually volunteered to help teach Logo programming.
Although I don't think my mother had any programming experience before that, so I assume she picked it up just before teaching it.
So, at least back then, my mother was involved in teaching me how to program.
My father actually did have exposure to computers, teletype machines, and some low level programming — but, for whatever reason, he didn't get involved with teaching me how to program. Or at least, I don't recall him doing so. Although he was involved in my education in a number of other ways.

Later on when I was older and in high school, in either the late 1980s or early 1990s I did some programming in the BASIC programming language.
It was part of one of my high school classes — a class on computers.

To do this _BASIC programming_ I used the computers they had at the high school I was attending at the time.
Still, even then, it still wasn't common for people to have computers at home.
So, for many young adults in their teenage years, if they were programming, it was often using a computer at their school as part of a computer class.

A little later on, in the 1990s, after convincing my parents to buy a personal-computer (PC) for our home — a desktop-computer based on the old Intel 80486 CPU — I learned how to program on my own, by reading (physical) books and (physical) magazines.

This was _before_ the Internet and the Web became ubiquitous.
So if you wanted to learn something, you couldn't just go on the Internet or the Web to learn it — really, for most people, all you had were (physical) books and (physical) magazines.
And, for books, you had to find a bookstore that sold computer programming books — which wasn't always easy.

But when I got into programming this time, I didn't stop, because I finally had access to a computer that I could program on anytime I wanted — since it was a computer we had at home.
I kept on programming, more and more and more.

With this personal-computer (PC) I convinced my parents to get — at first, after learning how to use the DOS command-line shell, I learned how to program _DOS batch files_. After that got back in _BASIC programming_ by learning how to program in _QBasic_.

Eventually, while in university (despite, at the time, mathematics being my intended major) I started taking computer science courses for fun.

While in university, I both took more and more computer science courses, learning more and more programming languages, and programming topics.
But I also kept learning programming on my own.
I actually learned more on my own by reading (physical) books, reading (physical) magazines, and eventually by participating on Internet e-mail mailing lists, by participating on Usenet newsgroups, and by reading web-pages.

Eventually I graduated and had a career as a computer programmer.
(Although my career was non-typical. And I did a lot of things that computer programmers typically don't do.)
